# PlotPlayground

A Swift playground that comes pre-loaded with [Plot](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Plot), so that you can quickly try out the library and its new, SwiftUI-like API for building HTML pages.

**To get started, follow these steps:**

1. Make sure that you have the latest, non-beta version of Xcode installed.
2. Clone the project to your local machine.
3. Open `PlotPlayground.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
4. Make sure that the `Playground` item is selected in the left-hand navigator pane.
5. Build the project using `‚åò + B`.
6. The playground should now automatically start running, but if it doesn‚Äôt, press the play button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) at the bottom of the Xcode UI to start it manually.
7. Have fun exploring Plot! üòÄ
